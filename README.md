# Web-Scraping

- We want to create a list of recipes and links to the recipes
- We need to figure out how to ‘programmatically’ extract each recipe name and recipe link
- Search for the tag with a unique attribute value that identifies recipes and recipe links
- We’ll look at the a (annotate) tags because clickable links are in a tags
